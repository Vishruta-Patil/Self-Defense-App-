      A rolled-up newspaper can be used to devastating effect against an attacker. Driven
      into the stomach, for example, it will wind a opponent, allowing you to escape.

      The Kubotan is an effective tool if used correctly. Forcing it under an attacker's nose
      (left) will cause severe pain, and forced on the back of an attacker's hand will release 
      his grip (right).

      The Kubotan can be forced into an attacker's neck (left) or hard upnunder the jaw (right).
      The latter is particularly useful if an attacker is side on to you.

       A walking stick can be a useful self-defence aid. Hold it like a quater staff for jabs and 
       blocks. Do not start swinging it like a sword, as an attacker might catch it and yank it away.
