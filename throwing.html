      Where the head goes, so does the rest of the body. So if you can control an ataacker's head, 
      you can use it to put him down on the ground, without using a great deal of strength. 
      Before you can turn the head, though, you need to push it right back, otherwise the neck 
      muscles will be too strong for you to overcome.

      So in this case, when an attacker grabs you from 
      the front, swing your left arm up and over the top, bringing it down on the on the hinge of his 
      right arm.Come in with your right palm and drive it into his chin, pushing the head right back 
      (opposite, top left).

      Step forward and grab the back of his head with left arm, as you keep 
      pushing back with your right arm (opposite, bottom left). Now shove his chin to your left, 
      pulling the back of his head towards you and down at the same time.

      Control his head around and 
      down, to your left, forcing him on to the ground and onto his back (above).
